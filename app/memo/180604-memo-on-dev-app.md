# TO DO
- When introducing phone number .. use +82 etc.
- Consider Material design (actually should, since it may be regarded as a kind of manifestation of our care)

# UI design
## main UI
- suggest some tips or cafe, etc. in the app, like a newsfeed in facebook; just scroll down the main screen of the app, then they'll see some hopefully useful contents.
- As a simple implementation, each content may have a single web view, corresponding to that part of section in the main md file.



# Search Engine
## Some ideas
- SQLite3
- a full-text search (using FTS3)
